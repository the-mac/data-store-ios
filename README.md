# Data Store iOS
[Data Store](http://operators.github.io/data-store-ios) is the [Eloquent based ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/eloquent) (for iOS) that also provides a beautiful, simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your data storage. Each database table has a corresponding "[Model](http://operators.github.io/data-store-ios/Classes/Model.html)" which is used to interact with that table. Models allow you to insert new records into the table, query for data in your tables, as well as update (and delete from) the table.
