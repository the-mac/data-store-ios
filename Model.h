/** The Model class is a new Object Relational Model (ORM) based upon Laravel Eloquent Models, and made specifically for iOS development.<br/><br/>Each property of the Model class implementation will generate the appropriate column in the underlying database table.<br/><br/>As in the example below, to pass data to a Flight database table, the Model class needs to be subclassed and a save message needs to be passed to the Flight instance.
 
 ```
 Flight *flight = [[Flight alloc] init];    // Or in Swift: let flight = Flight()
 
 flight.name = @"Flight 143";               // Or in Swift: flight.name = "Flight 143"
 
 [flight save];                             // Or in Swift: flight.save()
 ```
